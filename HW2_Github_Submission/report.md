# Report for HW2
This submission contains:
- Analytical solutions for the assigned exercises (5.1, 6.10, 7.3, 7.10).
- A robust Python implementation of Newton's method (with safeguards) to find roots of ln(x-1)+cos(x-1)=0 to within 1e-5 (outputs all roots found in a scanned interval).
Run `python3 newton_method.py` to see roots and iteration logs.
