# Exercise 5.1 — Householder QR for Example 5.2 (Solomon)
**Example 5.2 matrix** (textbook):

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

(see textbook Example 5.2). fileciteturn6file13

## (a) Householder reflections
We apply two Householder reflections to zero below-diagonal entries.

Carrying out the standard procedure (see §5.5 in the text) yields the QR factorization
(with arithmetic shown in the textbook example):
- The Gram–Schmidt orthonormal Q found in the book is
\[
Q = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 1/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & -1/\sqrt{2}
\end{pmatrix},
\]
and
\[
R = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & \sqrt{2} & 1/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & 0 & 1/\sqrt{2}
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
These match the example in the book. fileciteturn6file13

## (b) Do we get the same QR?
Yes — Householder QR and (modified) Gram–Schmidt produce the same factorization up to the signs of columns of Q (equivalently, corresponding sign changes in R). Using orthogonality and uniqueness of the reduced R (up to sign), the two methods coincide in column spaces; any sign differences are conventional choices in constructing reflections or normalizations.
