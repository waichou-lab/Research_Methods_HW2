# Exercise 6.10 — Symmetric positive definite matrices (full solutions)

Suppose A,B ∈ R^{n×n} symmetric and positive definite. (Textbook exercise 6.10). fileciteturn6file14

**(a) Define sqrt(A) and show (sqrt(A))^2 = A.**

By the Spectral Theorem, A = Q Λ Q^T with orthogonal Q and diagonal Λ=diag(λ_i), λ_i>0. Define
\[ \sqrt{A} \equiv Q \sqrt{\Lambda} Q^T, \quad \sqrt{\Lambda}=\mathrm{diag}(\sqrt{\lambda_i}).\]
Then (\sqrt{A})^2 = Q \sqrt{\Lambda} Q^T Q \sqrt{\Lambda} Q^T = Q (\sqrt{\Lambda})^2 Q^T = Q Λ Q^T = A. Note this sqrt(A) is symmetric positive definite; it is generally not the same as the (lower-triangular) Cholesky factor L in A=LL^T because L is triangular while sqrt(A) is symmetric. fileciteturn6file15

**(b) Do most matrices have unique square roots?**

For symmetric positive definite matrices, the spectral construction above gives a unique symmetric positive definite square root. But general (non-symmetric) matrices may have multiple square roots or none; uniqueness fails without extra structure because similarity transformations to Jordan form allow different choices (and non-diagonalizable blocks lead to complications). So “most” matrices in general do not have a unique square root unless we restrict to the PSD symmetric class. fileciteturn6file15

**(c) Matrix exponential in terms of eigenvectors/eigenvalues**

If A = Q Λ Q^T (symmetric), then
\[ e^{A} = Q e^{\Lambda} Q^T, \quad e^{\Lambda}=\mathrm{diag}(e^{\lambda_i}), \]
because the power-series definition converges and acts on eigenvalues. More generally, if A is diagonalizable A = X Λ X^{-1} then e^{A} = X e^{\Lambda} X^{-1}. fileciteturn6file15

**(d) If AB = BA, show e^{A+B}=e^{A} e^{B}.**

If A and B commute and are simultaneously triangularizable (or diagonalizable), the power-series expansion gives
\[ e^{A+B} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(A+B)^k}{k!}. \]
Since A and B commute, binomial expansion holds for (A+B)^k and the Cauchy product of the two series yields e^{A}e^{B}. Equivalently, if A and B are simultaneously diagonalizable then the identity reduces to scalar exponentials on the diagonal. fileciteturn6file15

**(e) ODE solution**

Consider y'(t) = -A y(t), y(0)=y_0. The solution is y(t)=e^{-At} y_0. This follows by differentiating: d/dt e^{-At} y_0 = (-A) e^{-At} y_0. As t→∞, since A is positive definite, all eigenvalues λ_i>0 so e^{-λ_i t}→0 and hence y(t)→0 (the zero vector) exponentially fast.
